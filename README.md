# Hit Combo Maker
Hit Combo Maker is a crafter for an always-comfortable playlist using Spotify API.
Select the artists and you'll get two tracks of each artist on the list.

##Why two tracks? 
if you LOVE the artist, ensures more than one song, cool!
if you like the artist, two songs are enough, yeah!
if you don't like the artist, better remove him/her from the playlist.

##Combos has types (WIP)
You can choose from a combination of
- Trending: new and popular song.
- Classic: oldie and popular song.

- Discover: new and not yet popular song.
