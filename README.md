# Hit Combo Factory
[Hit Combo Factory](http://cosmitar.github.io/hit-combo-factory/) is a crafter for an always-comfortable playlist using Spotify API.
Select the artists and you'll get two tracks of each artist on the list.
[Try this work-in-progress example](http://cosmitar.github.io/hit-combo-factory/)

##Why two tracks? 
**It's the perfect balance**

if you LOVE the artist, ensures more than one song, cool!

if you're ok with the artist, two songs are enough, yeah!

if you don't like the artist, better remove him/her from the playlist

##Combos has types
You can choose from a combination of
- Trending (default): new and popular song.
- Classic: oldie and popular song. (WIP)
- HIT: a popular song of a couple of years ago. (WIP)
- Discovery: new and not yet popular song. (WIP)

##Additional functionality
- You can let Hit Combo Factory suggest you artists related with current selection.
- Remove a song and Hit Combo Factory will find another one from that artist for you.
- Export the playlist to your Spotify account.
- We can suggest you the playlist name :D
