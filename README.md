# Hit Combo Maker
[Hit Combo Maker](http://cosmitar.github.io/hit-combo-maker/) is a crafter for an always-comfortable playlist using Spotify API.
Select the artists and you'll get two tracks of each artist on the list.
[Try this work-in-progress example](http://cosmitar.github.io/hit-combo-maker/)

##Why two tracks? 
**It's the perfect blance**

if you LOVE the artist, ensures more than one song, cool!

if you're ok with the artist, two songs are enough, yeah!

if you don't like the artist, better remove him/her from the playlist (WIP)

##Combos has types (WIP)
You can choose from a combination of
- Trending: new and popular song.
- Classic: oldie and popular song.
- HIT: a popular song of a couple of years ago.
- Discovery: new and not yet popular song.

##Additional functionality
- You can let Hit Combo Maker suggest you artists related with current selection.
- Preview the resultant playlist (WIP).
- Export the playlist to your Spotify account (WIP).
